We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master` or the current branch version. 
2. If you've added code make sure to test it (no problem if it doesn't work at first commit though).
3. Keep pull requests small and aim to solve a simple problem. Make many pull requests if problems are different.
4. If you think your pull request is big, you can always start a new issue to discuss it together.
